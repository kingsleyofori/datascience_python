# House Rent Prediction Dataset

## 1.0 Introduction

What factors affect the cost of renting a home in other countries?

In an ideal world, supply and demand pressures would be the driving forces behind any product on the market. House prices rise as a result of an overabundance of demand and a lack of supply, while the converse occurs when the two factors are reversed. This is particularly apparent in Ghana, where the country's accommodation costs have increased due to the country's high housing demand and supply. Does this correspond with what's going on globally?

## 3.0 Background Story

In India, housing options range from the palaces of former maharajas to contemporary apartment buildings in major cities to modest huts in remote regions. The housing market in India has expanded significantly as wages have increased. According to the Human Rights Measurement Initiative, India is only achieving 60.9% of the right to housing at its current income level.

A contract for the temporary use of a good, service, or piece of property that belongs to someone else is known as renting, sometimes known as hiring, or letting. A gross lease is one in which the landlord covers all normal property expenses paid by the ownership in addition to the tenant's fixed monthly rent payment.  Renting can be an example of the sharing economy.
