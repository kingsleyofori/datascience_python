| Project Name | Area | Description | Libraries Used |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🏘️ [House Rent Prediction](https://github.com/kingsleyofori/datascience_python/tree/master/House%20Rent%20Prediction) |   Data Wrangling, Machine Learning & EDA | Exploratory Analysis of more than 4,000+ rental housing dataset in India to better understand the housing situation in the country, coupled with the usuage of just Linear Regression in building and testing a model | _pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn_ | 
| 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 [World Population Analysis](https://github.com/kingsleyofori/datascience_python/tree/master/World%20Population%20Analysis) |   Data Wrangling & EDA | Exploratory Analysis of the World Population from 1970 to 2022. | _pandas, matplotlib, seaborn_ | 
| 🌏🏙️ [Madrid Real Estate Market](https://github.com/kingsleyofori/datascience_python/tree/master/Madrid%20Real%20Estate%20Market) |   Data Wrangling, Machine Learning & EDA | Exploratory Analysis of more than 20,000+ entries of real estate listings in Madrid to better understand the housing situation in Spain's capital. Attached to this EDA is a machine learning model to predict the prices of properties. | _pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn_ |
