# Real Estate Market in Madrid, Spain.

High levels of urbanization, migration, and population expansion have resulted in a growing real estate market, and this is especially true for Madrid, Spain's capital city. According to articles and observations, it appears that the Spanish real estate market is making a full recovery to pre-covid levels and is regaining its health because, according to the national institute of statistics, 2021 was the year that displayed the best figures in property sales in the previous 14 years.

## Objective

In this project, I'll take a machine learning approach to the issue by creating an estimation of the fair offer price for the specified real estate in Madrid using the available dataset. A supervised offline regression that can determine a property's offer price based on inputs is the project's output. Offline is referenced in this context since the model is not learning in real time, but rather is making predictions based on snapshot(supplied) information I have provided about the real estate listings in the mentioned capital.

## About the data

This dataset contains the real estate listings from popular real estate portals of Madrid and is hosted on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirbektoktogaraev/madrid-real-estate-market). It is believed to have been crawled from popular real estate listing websites.

Madrid is one of the most frequently visited cities in Europe by visitors and business travelers, and it is home to many significant local and international corporations. As a result, Madrid has a high volume of both tourists and residents looking to advance their lives professionally. According to statistics on real estate listings, we discovered that the housing market has been expanding for a number of years. As a result, you can still find homes at very reasonable prices (especially when compared to other European capitals), with a good chance of their value increasing in the future. Although they are uncommon in the city center, single-family residences can be found there. Madrid also has a mix of new construction and existing apartments. Real estate prices in capital cities are generally the most expensive in a country, but it's not the case in Spain. The cost of property in Madrid is well below that of Barcelona and coastal areas.
