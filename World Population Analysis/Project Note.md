# World Population Analysis

![](Population%20Image%20Header.jpg)

## Background

In a CNN piece I recently read, Elon Musk, the billionaire, was criticized for tweeting that "population collapse due to birth rates is a much bigger menace to civilzation than global warming." What is evident in this news, say demographers, is that despite losses in some regions of the world, the world's population is rising and shouldn't be collapsing any time soon â€“ even with birth rates at lower levels than in the past. This simple exploratory analysis dives into the population dataset provided to us through Kaggle to better understand the nature of the world's population from 1970 to 2022.

## Task

This project seeks to explore the population dataset to better understand the population from its start date to today. I also had a crazy idea to reverse engineer the whole process, so that the population trends in the previous years could be used to predict the population of the future. However, for this feat to be done, there should be more than just the statistics of the populations given.

## Queries

- What is the **most** populated continent in the world at the moment?
- What is the **most** populated country in the world at the moment?
- What is the **least** populated continent in the world at the moment?
- What is the **least** populated country in the world at the moment?
- Is there a relationship between the numerical characteristics of human population along the years?
